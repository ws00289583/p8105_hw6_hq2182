### Problem 1

Create a `city_state` variable, (i.e. “Baltimore, MD”);  
binary variable indicating whether the homicide is solved (0 = unsolved,
1 = solved);  
omit cities Dallas, TX; Phoenix, AZ; and Kansas City, MO, did this at
the beginning: na = c("“,”NA“,”Unknown");  
omit Tulsa, AL;  
keep `victim_race` = `white` or `black`, make `victim_age` as numeric.

``` r
homicide_df = 
  read_csv("data/homicide-data.csv", na = c("", "NA", "Unknown")) %>% 
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = ", "),
    victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age),
    resolution = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ 0,
      disposition == "Open/No arrest"        ~ 0,
      disposition == "Closed by arrest"      ~ 1),
    victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age)) %>% 
  filter(
    city_state != "Tulsa, AL") %>% 
  select(city_state, resolution, victim_age, victim_race, victim_sex)
```

Start with the city of Baltimore, MD, fit a logistic regression with
resolved vs unresolved as the outcome and victim age, sex and race as
predictors;  
Obtain the estimate and confidence interval of the adjusted odds ratio
for solving homicides comparing non-white victims to white victims
keeping all other variables fixed.

``` r
baltimore_df =
  homicide_df %>% 
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD") %>% 
  mutate(
    victim_race = factor(victim_race, levels = c("White", "Black", "Hispanic", "Asian", "Other"))
  )


glm(resolution ~ victim_age + victim_race + victim_sex, 
    data = baltimore_df,
    family = binomial()) %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  mutate(
    OR = exp(estimate),
    CI_lower = exp(estimate - 1.96 * std.error),
    CI_upper = exp(estimate + 1.96 * std.error)
  ) %>% 
  select(term, OR, starts_with("CI")) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)
```

| term                 |    OR | CI\_lower | CI\_upper |
| :------------------- | ----: | --------: | --------: |
| (Intercept)          | 3.287 |     2.075 |     5.209 |
| victim\_age          | 0.993 |     0.986 |     0.999 |
| victim\_raceBlack    | 0.431 |     0.306 |     0.607 |
| victim\_raceHispanic | 0.767 |     0.412 |     1.427 |
| victim\_raceAsian    | 1.345 |     0.369 |     4.905 |
| victim\_raceOther    | 0.464 |     0.082 |     2.620 |
| victim\_sexMale      | 0.415 |     0.318 |     0.542 |

Do the same thing for all cities in the data;  
extract the adjusted odds ratio (and CI) for solving homicides comparing
Black victims to White victims;

``` r
models_results_df = 
  homicide_df %>% 
  filter(
    victim_race %in% c("Black","White")) %>% 
  nest(data = -city_state) %>% 
  mutate(
    models = 
      map(.x = data, ~glm(resolution ~ victim_age + victim_race + victim_sex, data = .x, family = binomial())),
    results = map(models, broom::tidy)
  ) %>% 
  select(city_state, results) %>% 
  unnest(results) %>% 
  mutate(
    OR = exp(estimate),
    CI_lower = exp(estimate - 1.96 * std.error),
    CI_upper = exp(estimate + 1.96 * std.error)
  ) %>% 
  select(city_state, term, OR, starts_with("CI")) %>% 
  filter(term == "victim_raceWhite")

head(models_results_df)
```

    ## # A tibble: 6 x 5
    ##   city_state      term                 OR CI_lower CI_upper
    ##   <chr>           <chr>             <dbl>    <dbl>    <dbl>
    ## 1 Albuquerque, NM victim_raceWhite  1.51     0.668     3.41
    ## 2 Atlanta, GA     victim_raceWhite  1.31     0.749     2.28
    ## 3 Baltimore, MD   victim_raceWhite  2.32     1.65      3.27
    ## 4 Baton Rouge, LA victim_raceWhite  1.56     0.729     3.36
    ## 5 Birmingham, AL  victim_raceWhite  0.934    0.553     1.58
    ## 6 Boston, MA      victim_raceWhite 10.6      4.30     26.3

Create a plot that shows the estimated ORs and CIs for each city;  
Organize cities according to estimated OR;  
Zoom in the plot because some cities have very large OR, but most ORs
are in range 1\~4.

``` r
models_results_df %>% 
  mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, OR)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = OR)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = CI_lower, ymax = CI_upper)) + 
  ylab("OR for solved homicides (Black vs. White)") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) +
  coord_cartesian(ylim=c(0,5))
```

Comment: On average, cases with White victim were more likely to be
solved (OR \> 1). In some cities such as Oakland and Boston, the ORs
were larger than 5, even the lower bound of CI was much more greater
than 1. These cities should consider how to deal with discrimination
based on race.

### Problem 2

Read and clean data.

  - The column names are tidy so no need to do anything.

  - 
<!-- end list -->

``` r
baby_df = 
  read_csv("./data/birthweight.csv")
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   .default = col_double()
    ## )

    ## See spec(...) for full column specifications.
